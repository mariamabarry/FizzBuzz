# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is a program that generates a list of numbers from 1 to 100, giving users the ability to designate two specific values as the Fizz and Buzz parameters. The application will display "Fizz" for numbers divisible by the Fizz parameter, "Buzz" for those divisible by the Buzz parameter, and "FizzBuzz" for numbers divisible by both values.
